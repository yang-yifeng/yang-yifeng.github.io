<h2 class="section-title">Teaching</h2>

<h3 class="section-title">Module Leader</h3>
*Ship Structures (MECH0103), UCL* &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="float:right;">06 / 2024 – Now</span>  
The module covers the design and structural strength assessment of advanced marine vehicles, as well as advanced design and computational methods in ship engineering. As module leader, I lead a team of one Tutor and two PGTAs. My main responsibilities include delivering MSc lectures and coordinating all related teaching activities. 

<h3 class="section-title">Module Tutor</h3>
*Seakeeping and Manoeuvring (MECH0105), UCL* &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="float:right;">06 / 2024 – Now</span>  
Responsible for tutorials focused on analysing the hydrodynamic responses and motions of ships and offshore structures in waves, using software such as MAXSURF and PARAMARAN (25% of the module).

<h3 class="section-title">PGTA Roles</h3>
*Mathematical Modelling and Analysis II (ENGF0004), UCL* &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="float:right;">09 / 2021 – 06 / 2023</span>  
Delivered tutorials for second-year students (25% of the module), demonstrating solutions, teaching MATLAB, and answering questions. Assisted Prof Emad Moeendarbary, Dr Liwei Guo, and Dr Iva Burova with coursework grading.

*Mechanical Engineering Practical Skills (MECH0004), UCL* &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="float:right;">01 / 2020 – 06 / 2022</span>  
Taught students to operate compressors and measure system energy efficiency (20% of the module). During COVID-19, I created a **virtual lab** and recorded an instructional video for remote teaching. Also conducted coursework tutorials.

*Advanced Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics (MECH0024), UCL* &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="float:right;">09 / 2019 – 03 / 2020</span>  
Assisted Prof Ian Eames in preparing lecture slides and notes.

<h2 class="section-title">(Co-)Supervision</h2>

<h3 class="section-title">Undergraduate Individual Projects</h3>
*MECH0020, UCL* &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="float:right;">01 / 2020 – Now</span>  

<h3 class="section-title">MSc Individual Projects</h3>
*MECH0070, UCL* &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="float:right;">01 / 2020 – Now</span>  

I supervise students in the completion of research projects proposed by Prof Guoxiong Wu and myself. This involves technical support with CFD software (ANSYS FLUENT, STAR-CCM+, OpenFOAM) and guidance on academic report/thesis writing.
