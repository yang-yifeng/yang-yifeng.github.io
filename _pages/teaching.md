- **MECH0103: Ship Structures** — Module Leader, UCL (06/2024 – Now).  
Covers the design and structural strength assessment of advanced marine vehicles, as well as advanced design and computational methods in ship engineering. I lead a team of one Tutor and two PGTAs, deliver MSc lectures, and coordinate all related activities. Received **100% student satisfaction** in end-of-term feedback.
