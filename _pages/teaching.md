: Module Coordinator, University College London (06/2024 â€“ Present).  
  This module covers the design and structural strength assessment of advanced marine vehicles, with a focus on modern design principles and computational methods in ship engineering. As the module coordinator, I manage a teaching team comprising one Tutor and one PGTA. My major work includes delivering lectures for MSc students, coordinating tutorials and assessments, and overseeing all associated teaching activities.
