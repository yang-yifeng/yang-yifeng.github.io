I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from [University College London (UCL), UK](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in November 2023, after completing a BEng degree at [Zhejiang University, China](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2019. My research lies in Marine Hydrodynamics, with a focus on the interaction of ocean surface waves with offshore structures, floating renewable devices, and sea ice in polar regions. Using analytical, numerical, and experimental approaches, I investigate the physical mechanisms underlying waveâ€“structure interactions, with the main target of advancing the understanding of ocean dynamics and supporting safer and more resilient marine engineering.

I have strong research experience in fluid mechanics, mathematical modelling, and script development, including those based on finite element methods (FEM), boundary element methods (BEM), and analytical approaches. I have (co-)authored over 20 publications in flagship journals in fluid mechanics and ocean engineering, such as Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Physical Review Fluids, and Ocean Engineering. 

I have served as Module Coordinator for [MECH0103 Ship Structures](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/ship-structures-MECH0103) at UCL since June 2024 and was awarded Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) in July 2025.
