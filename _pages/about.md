I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from [University College London (UCL), UK](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in November 2023, after completing a BEng degree at [Zhejiang University, China](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2019. My research lies in Marine Hydrodynamics, with a focus on the interaction of ocean surface waves with offshore structures, floating renewable devices, and sea ice in polar regions. Using analytical, numerical, and experimental approaches, I investigate the physical mechanisms underlying waveâ€“structure interactions, with the main target of advancing the understanding of ocean dynamics and supporting safer and more resilient marine engineering.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
